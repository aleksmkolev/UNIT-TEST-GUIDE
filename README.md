Unit Testing Configuration
Guide for installing and setting up the needed libraries and frameworks to allow local testing of JavaScript code for the "JavaScript Advanced" course @ SoftUni in WebStorm and Visual Studio Code.
Visual Studio Code Configuration
It's generally recommended to install testing libraries locally within each project. This ensures that each project has the correct version of the library it needs and that all project dependencies are clearly documented in the package.json file. 
Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the directory of your project and execute the following commands:
npm init
npm install
npm install chai
npm install mocha
The structure of your UNIT-TESTING folder should look something like this:
 
Running Our First Mocha Test
In order to be able to run Mocha tests, you have to make some additional steps. 
Start by creating a new folder, named "test", in the directory where you ran the commands from above. Your UNIT TESTING folder should look like this:
 
For the purposes of this session, it doesn't matter which standard you'd prefer to use â€“ ESM or CommonJS. Below you will find instructions on how to run your tests in both ways. Remember that the Judge system expects only the testing code, without the imports/exports / require()/module.exports code.
ESM
If you want to use the ESM standard, follow the steps below.
Add a new file to the UNIT-TESTING folder and name it sumNumbers.js.  
Use the code bellow:
sumNumbers.js
export function sum(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let num of arr){
        sum += Number(num);
    }
    return sum;
}
Now, add a new file to the test folder and name it sumNumbersTest.js. Use the code below:
sumNumbersTest.js
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { sum } from '../sumNumbers.js'; 

describe('Sum numbers', () => {
    it('sums single number', () => {
        expect(sum([1])).to.equal(1);
    });

    // Test overloading
    it('sums multiple numbers', () => {
        expect(sum([1,1])).to.equal(2);
    });

    it('sums different numbers', () => {
        expect(sum([2,3,4])).to.equal(9);
    });
});
Your UNIT-TESTING folder should look like this:
 
If we want to use the standard '.js' extension for the test files, when using the ESM Standard, we have two options:
â€¢	We can rename the test files and give them the '.mjs' extension 
â€¢	We can keep the extension '.js', but we have to add "type": "modules" in our package.json file. This specifies that the '.js' files are ES modules.
In this tutorial, we will choose the second option. 
There are two ways to run Mocha tests. The first one is using the command mocha, which by default will look for test files in the "test" directory and run all of them. If you want to run specific test files, use the command mocha path/to/test.js.
For our example, we will use the mocha command. This is the other change that we have to make in our package.json file. 
In order to use the mocha command, we will add it to the scripts section in the package.json file and indicate to our Node.js project to run this command when we type npm test command.
NOTE: The scripts section in the package.json file defines shortcuts for custom shell commands that are related to the lifecycle of a Node.js project. It allows developers to run tasks such as starting the application, running tests, or custom build processes with simple commands like npm start or npm test.
Finally, your package.json file should look like this:
  
After we have made our changes, we can simply open a terminal and run the command npm test. If you have set up everything correctly, you should get this output:
 
CommonJS
If you chose the CommonJS standard, you don't have to change the file extension of the test files and you don't need to add "type": "module" in the package.json file.
The sumNumbers.js should look like the code below:

sumNumbers.js
function sum(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let num of arr){
        sum += Number(num);
    }
    return sum;
}
module.exports = { sum };
The sumNumbersTest.js should look like the code below:
sumNumbersTest.js
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { sum } = require('../sumNumbers');

describe('Sum numbers', () => {
    it('sums single number', () => {
        expect(sum([1])).to.equal(1);
    });

    // Test overloading
    it('sums multiple numbers', () => {
        expect(sum([1,1])).to.equal(2);
    });

    it('sums different numbers', () => {
        expect(sum([2,3,4])).to.equal(9);
    });
});
We are still going to use the scripts section of the package.json file to run the test.
However, the latest versions of Chai are ES modules, which can't be loaded, if we want to use the require()/module.exports syntax. To fix this error, we will have to downgrade to a version of Chai, which still supports CommonJS. 
To downgrade the version of Chai, we will make changes in the dependencies section of the package.json file. Finally, it should look like this:
 
After we have made changes to the dependencies section, we have to run the npm install command again in order for the changes to the version to take effect.
Our next step is to simply open a terminal and run the command npm test. If you have set up everything correctly, you should get this output:
 
Congratulations! You have run your first Mocha and Chai test! ðŸ˜Š
